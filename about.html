              <p class="fs-1 fw-bold shadow-lg">About Us</p>
              <p>The music world is often seen as 'black and white'.  Alexander likes to view the music world as a multicoloured palette, where you are only limited to what your imagination and creativity can do.</p>
              <p>Alexander's goal is to ensure every student receives proper instruction, and to make learning music fun for students of any age.</p>
              <p>Do you have young children or grandchildren?  We offer a children's music class that introduces music to young children that prepares them for private lessons if requested.  If a class is not for your child, then perhaps a private lesson curriculum is more for you.</p>
              <p>Are your children or grandchildren past the toddler age?  Not a problem.  Alexander offers curriculum that is geared towards students who are starting at a later age.</p>
              <p>Already studying music?  We can help you with your theory homework, solo instrument instruction and even post-secondary audition preparation.</p>
              <p>Busy schedule?  Lessons are offered in your home!</p>
              <p>And speaking of home, are your children home-schooled or you are part of a home-schooling network?  Fantastic!! We cater to you too!</p>
              <p>For a complete list of programs offered, please visit the <a class="link-danger fw-bold" href="programs.html">Programs</a> tab above or continue reading to meet Alexander!</p>

              <p id="Alex">Hello!</p>
              <p>My name is, Alexander, and welcome to my School of Music!!</p>
              <p>Growing up in Niagara Falls, Canada, I began studying music at the age of 15, after sitting down in front of a piano at a relative's house during the Christmas holidays and entertaining myself while the adults conversed.  After hearing me, my mother insisted I begin to study music when I entered high school, even though I wanted to take art classes like the rest of my friends were doing.  To this day, I still thank her for making that choice, and as a result, I have had a wonderful, fun, and fulfilling career.</p>
              <p>After being taught by some wonderful teachers during my high school years and provided with many great opportunities, I continued my post-secondary studies at Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario, where I graduated from the Applied Music Program, specializing in Performance, Composition and Conducting.  It was during my final year that I discovered my love for composing and continued my education at York University in Toronto, working towards my Bachelor of Fine Arts degree with my major being Music Composition.  While at York, I also began writing music for Canadian films and television, a career I thoroughly enjoy.</p>
              <p>So why have I opened a School of Music, you may ask yourself?  Well, I have been a music teacher for at least 20 years, teaching students of all ages, group sizes and in conservatory settings as well as private instruction.  For me, it's very rewarding to inspire music students through my experiences as a professional performer, composer, a teacher and a student. I originally launched my school in 2013 in the Barrie, Ontario, region to great success, receiving the Entrepreneur Of The Year Business Award in 2014, the second highest South Simcoe Business Award, and I have recently relocated back to the Niagara Region and want to share my love of music with students of all ages here.</p><br>
